# Gnaneshwar

Hi, I’m Sai Gnaneshwar. 

I’m a Software Engineer with a background in building cloud-native applications and distributed backend systems. Most of my work is focused on Java, TypeScript, Node.js, and AWS. I’ve built and deployed services using Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, EKS, and Kafka, and I enjoy working on systems that need to be scalable, reliable, and easy to maintain.

I’ve worked on projects involving REST API development, event-driven pipelines, CI/CD automation, and containerized services. I’ve also spent time improving performance, designing data models, and strengthening observability in production systems.

Some of the projects I’ve worked on include a task orchestration service on AWS and a dashboard for visualizing Kafka event streams and cluster metrics. I like working across the stack, collaborating with teams, and building solutions that make a clear impact.

Thanks for stopping by my profile.
